qhy5tviewer
================

This project originally by Jwackyto https://github.com/jwackito/qhy5tviewer

On this fork am just updating the code to make it compile in gcc 9 and also added a CMakeLists.txt file so to compile it with cmake



Get the code:
===========
Just clone it:
  
   git clone https://github.com/monticellifernando/qhy5tviewer.git


Compile it:
=========

   mkdir build
   cmake ../qhy5tviewer
   make


It was easy right?. Now you need to install few things. I.e. those in etc here, just copy them in your system (under /etc/) it should just work
